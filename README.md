# Stokes Parameters for Monochromatic Waves

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates calculating the Stokes Parameters and visualizing the polarization with linearly and circularly polarized vectors. It is licensed under the GNU GPL3 license.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following python modules:
- ipython
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Usage
The repository can be accessed by typing:
**git clone https://github.com/hrbates/Stokes-Parameters.git** <br>
To open the notebook, type:
**cd stokes-parameters** <br>
Finally, type:
**jupyter notebook stokes-parameters.ipynb**

**NOTE**: The length of the polarization vectors are slightly off. Scaling is an issue, and I was unable to solve the problem. Also, in the future it would be benefitial to animate the polarization to see the vectors move and 'draw out' the overall polarization ellipse/circle/line. I attempted to get the animation to work (without any success). It would be something to work on and improve later. For the purpose of this project, the Stokes Parameters are calculated and some visualization is obtained, which is sufficient.
